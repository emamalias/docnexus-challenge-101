Search engine for medical conferences.

### The challenge
Extract data from different sources for medical conferences.
Build a system to extract and index data from hundreds of thousands of medical conferences, including websites, PDFs, and session details.

These 2 websites have the names of all the Conferences:
- https://www.symplur.com/healthcare-hashtags/conferences/
- https://www.astellas.com/me/system/files/pre-approved_global_congress_list_2023_website.pdf

It would then need to search and find the sites and scrape the conference websites for session details and speakers, and extract structured data from unstructured sources like PDFs. It should also handle inconsistent formats, especially PDFs, to accurately parse and extract key information.

Goal is to build a fast, intuitive search engine allowing users to filter by session, speaker, year and topic across conferences. Design a system that can manage and update data from a massive, constantly growing dataset.
